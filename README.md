# Linuxify

You may use the configuration files in here to customize your linux. without the stress of doing it.. Manually.

There is a prompt before the packages will be installed.

This customization is tested on ubuntu/debian.

Haven't tried to other deb distros yet. You can help me so we can add compatilibity.
